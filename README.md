# Raspberry Pi workshops

These sessions are meant to get participants excited about the pi and demonstrate practical uses for it.

Session 1 :
The word document goes through the initial loading of the Raspbian operating system, next running an Apache webserver and serving web pages.
Next we go into setting up an open source media center.
The group eventually gets to hack a way to stream content from the www to the media center.
