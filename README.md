# Abstract

The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, quiet, credit card sized computer that plugs into a TV or monitor. With a 900 mhz quad core processor and 1GB RAM, in 2015 it sparked a maker revolution. Currently, the operating system is able to run languages such as Scrath and Python, however, software companies such as Microsoft are preparing to release light weight versions of Windows that can run on the Pi.

The Raspberry Pi Workshops are meant to be hands-on maker sessions to explore the various possible uses of the Pi. The early sessions will explore setup and exploration of existing open-source software for the Pi.

## Session 1 :
Explore the operating systems available and hardware involved in getting the computer up and connected to the www. 
Run a webserver and explore hosting a website.
Install an Open Source Media Center and configure options to download available media apps.
Explore ways to connect the Pis in the room.
